# JSON Reflection Demo
Tiny demo seralizer written to demonstrate Odin's reflection system, for a youtube video.

Feel free to explore the code, or run the demo yourself. Note that it expects an Odin version *after* the new os package was merged. If you want to make it work on an older version, it should as simple as changing `import "core:os"` to `import os "core:os/os2"`
